#### Africa
No direct evidence for conditions in the [Sahel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel "Sahel") region have been found, however conditions surrounding the area have implied above-normal rainfall. Below the Sahel, the coastal regions of West Africa likely experienced below-normal levels of precipitation. Data from Spanish sources may be interpreted to support the idea of a "simulated cooling" in northwest Africa, adjacent from Spain. Even further south, severe storms affected the South African coast during the South Hemisphere winter. On July 29–30 1816 a violent 36-hour storm occurred in the [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town "Cape Town") area (described as a "hurricane" by all ships who encountered it), which brought forceful northerly winds and [hail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail "Hail"), which caused severe damage to shipping at coast and at sea.
#### Asia
In [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty"), there was a profound famine. Floods destroyed many remaining crops. The [monsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon")season was disrupted, resulting in overwhelming floods in the [Yangtze Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_Valley "Yangtze Valley"). Fort [Shuangcheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuangcheng "Shuangcheng"), now in [Heilongjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilongjiang "Heilongjiang"), reported fields disrupted by frost and conscripts deserting as a result. Summer snowfall or otherwise [mixed precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_precipitation "Mixed precipitation") was reported in various locations in [Jiangxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi "Jiangxi") and [Anhui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui "Anhui"), located at around 30°N. In [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_under_Qing_rule "Taiwan under Qing rule"), which has a tropical climate, snow was reported in [Hsinchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsinchu "Hsinchu") and [Miaoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaoli_County "Miaoli County"), and frost was reported in [Changhua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changhua "Changhua").
In 1816, due to the abnormal climate caused by the volcanic eruption, there was a large-scale famine in [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan "Yunnan").This famine caused the [Qing Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty "Qing Dynasty") to turn from prosperity to decline.

In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), the delayed summer monsoon caused late torrential rains that aggravated the spread of [cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera "Cholera") from a region near the [Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges "Ganges") in [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal") to as far as Moscow. In the [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal") region of northeast India abnormal cold and snow was reported in the winter monsoon.

In Japan, which was still exercising caution after the cold-weather-related [Tenmei famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenmei_famine "Tenmei famine") of 1782–1788, cold damaged crops, but no crop failures were reported, and there were no adverse effects on population.

### Europe

As a result of the series of volcanic eruptions, crops had been poor for several years; the final blow came in 1815 with the eruption of Tambora. Europe, still recuperating from the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), suffered from food shortages. The impoverished especially suffered during this time. Low temperatures and heavy rains resulted in failed harvests in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") and [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland"). Families in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales") traveled long distances begging for food. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, [oat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat "Oat"), and potato harvests. In Germany, the crisis was severe. [Food prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices "Food prices") rose sharply throughout Europe. With the cause of the problems unknown, hungry people demonstrated in front of grain markets and bakeries. Later riots, arson, and [looting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting "Looting") took place in many European cities. On some occasions, rioters carried flags reading "Bread or Blood". Though riots were common during times of hunger, the food riots of 1816 and 1817 were the highest levels of violence since the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"). It was the worst [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine "Famine") of 19th-century mainland Europe.

Between 1816 and 1819, major [typhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus "Typhus") epidemics occurred in parts of Europe, including Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, and Scotland, precipitated by malnourishment and famine caused by the Year Without a Summer. More than 65,000 people died as the disease spread out of Ireland and onwards to Britain.

The long-running [Central England temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature "Central England temperature") record reported the 11th coldest year on record since 1659, as well as the 3rd coldest summer, and the coldest July on record. Huge storms and abnormal rainfall with flooding of Europe's major rivers (including the Rhine) are attributed to the event, as is the August frost. As a result of volcanic ash in the atmosphere, Hungary experienced brown snow. Italy's northern and north-central region experienced something similar, with red snow falling throughout the year.

The effects were widespread and lasted beyond the winter. In western [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), the summers of 1816 and 1817 were so cold that an [ice dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglacial_lake "Proglacial lake") formed below a tongue of the [Giétro Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%A9tro_Glacier "Giétro Glacier") high in the [Val de Bagnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_de_Bagnes "Val de Bagnes"). Despite engineer [Ignaz Venetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Venetz "Ignaz Venetz")'s efforts to drain the growing lake, the ice dam collapsed catastrophically in June 1818, killing 40 people.

### North America

In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent "dry fog" was observed in parts of the eastern United States. The fog reddened and dimmed the sunlight, such that [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot "Sunspot") were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the "fog". It has been characterized as a "stratospheric [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate "Sulfate") aerosol veil".

The weather was not in itself a hardship for those accustomed to long winters. Hardship came from the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. The consequences were felt most strongly at higher elevations, where farming was already difficult even in good years. In May 1816, [frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost "Frost") killed off most crops in the higher elevations of [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts "Massachusetts"), [New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire "New Hampshire"), and [Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont "Vermont"), as well as [upstate New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York "Upstate New York"). On June 6, snow fell in [Albany, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York "Albany, New York"), and [Dennysville, Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennysville,_Maine "Dennysville, Maine"). In [Cape May, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_May,_New_Jersey "Cape May, New Jersey"), frost was reported five nights in a row in late June, causing extensive crop damage. New England also experienced major consequences from the eruption of Tambora. Though fruits and vegetable crops survived, corn was reported to have ripened so poorly that no more than a quarter of it was usable for food. The moldy and unripe harvest was not even fit for animal feed. The crop failures in New England, Canada, and parts of Europe also caused the price of many staples to rise sharply. In Canada, Quebec ran out of bread and milk, and Nova Scotians found themselves boiling foraged herbs for sustenance.

Many commented on the phenomenon. Sarah Snell Bryant, of [Cummington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummington "Cummington"), [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts "Massachusetts"), wrote in her diary, "Weather backward."

At the Church Family of [Shakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers "Shakers") near [New Lebanon, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Lebanon,_New_York "New Lebanon, New York"), Nicholas Bennet wrote in May 1816, "all was froze" and the hills were "barren like winter". Temperatures went below freezing almost every day in May. The ground froze on June 9. On June 12, the Shakers had to replant crops destroyed by the cold. On July 7, it was so cold that everything had stopped growing. The [Berkshire Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hills "Berkshire Hills") had frost again on August 23, as did much of the upper northeast.

A Massachusetts historian summed up the disaster:

> Severe frosts occurred every month; June 7th and 8th snow fell, and it was so cold that crops were cut down, even freezing the roots ... In the early Autumn when corn was in the milk it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. It must be remembered that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.

(Here “to be in the milk” means “to be in the stage where the endosperm inside the kernel is still liquid” )

In July and August, lake and river ice was observed as far south as northwestern [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania"). Frost was reported as far south as [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia "Virginia") on August 20 and 21. Rapid, dramatic temperature swings were common, with temperatures sometimes reverting from normal or above-normal summer temperatures as high as 95 °F (35 °C) to near-freezing within hours. [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson"), retired from the presidency and farming at [Monticello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello "Monticello"), sustained crop failures that sent him further into debt. On September 13, a Virginia newspaper reported that corn crops would be one half to two-thirds short and lamented that "the cold as well as the drought has nipt the buds of hope". A [Norfolk, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia "Norfolk, Virginia") newspaper reported:

> It is now the middle of July, and we have not yet had what could properly be called summer. Easterly winds have prevailed for nearly three months past ... the sun during that time has generally been obscured and the sky overcast with clouds; the air has been damp and uncomfortable, and frequently so chilling as to render the fireside a desirable retreat.

Regional farmers succeeded in bringing some crops to maturity, but [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") and other [grain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal "Cereal") prices rose dramatically. The price of [oats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oats "Oats"), for example, rose from 12¢ per [bushel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushel "Bushel") ($3.40/m3) in 1815 (equal to $1.92 today) to 92¢ per bushel ($26/m3) in 1816 ($15.86 today). Crop failures were aggravated by an inadequate transportation network: with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads, it was expensive to import food.

Similar to Hungary and Italy, Maryland experienced brown, bluish, and yellow snowfall during April and May due to volcanic ash in the atmosphere.

### South America

A newspaper account of northeastern Brazil was published in the UK, and details that:

> By an arrival at Liverpool we have received accounts from [Pernambuco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco "Pernambuco") [modern [Recife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife "Recife")] of the 8th of Feb. [1817], which state that a most uncommon drought has been experienced in the tropical regions of the Brazils, or that part of the country between Pernambuco and [Rio Janiero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro "Rio de Janeiro"). By this circumstance all the streams had been dried up, the cattle were dying or dead, and all the population emigrating to the borders of the great rivers in search of water. The greatest distress prevailed, provisions were wanting, and the mills completely at a stand. They have no windmills, so that no corn could be ground. Vessels have been sent from Pernambuco to the United States to fetch flour, and what had tended to increase this distress was the interruption of the coasting trade through the dread of war with Buenos Ayres.

The account discusses an abnormal [drought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought "Drought"), and suggests that the rainy season (from March–May) had failed in 1816 and that by time the report had been written, February 8, 1817, little or no rain had come. With little food and water, the regional population migrated towards rivers in search of water.
