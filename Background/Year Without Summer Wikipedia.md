#### Africa
No direct evidence for conditions in the [Sahel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel "Sahel") region have been found, however conditions surrounding the area have implied above-normal rainfall. Below the Sahel, the coastal regions of West Africa likely experienced below-normal levels of precipitation. Data from Spanish sources may be interpreted to support the idea of a "simulated cooling" in northwest Africa, adjacent from Spain. Even further south, severe storms affected the South African coast during the South Hemisphere winter. On July 29–30 1816 a violent 36-hour storm occurred in the [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town "Cape Town") area (described as a "hurricane" by all ships who encountered it), which brought forceful northerly winds and [hail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail "Hail"), which caused severe damage to shipping at coast and at sea.
#### Asia
In [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty"), there was a profound famine. Floods destroyed many remaining crops. The [monsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon")season was disrupted, resulting in overwhelming floods in the [Yangtze Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_Valley "Yangtze Valley"). Fort [Shuangcheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuangcheng "Shuangcheng"), now in [Heilongjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilongjiang "Heilongjiang"), reported fields disrupted by frost and conscripts deserting as a result. Summer snowfall or otherwise [mixed precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_precipitation "Mixed precipitation") was reported in various locations in [Jiangxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi "Jiangxi") and [Anhui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui "Anhui"), located at around 30°N. In [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_under_Qing_rule "Taiwan under Qing rule"), which has a tropical climate, snow was reported in [Hsinchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsinchu "Hsinchu") and [Miaoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaoli_County "Miaoli County"), and frost was reported in [Changhua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changhua "Changhua").
In 1816, due to the abnormal climate caused by the volcanic eruption, there was a large-scale famine in [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan "Yunnan").This famine caused the [Qing Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty "Qing Dynasty") to turn from prosperity to decline.

In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), the delayed summer monsoon caused late torrential rains that aggravated the spread of [cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera "Cholera") from a region near the [Ganges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges "Ganges") in [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal") to as far as Moscow. In the [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal "Bengal") region of northeast India abnormal cold and snow was reported in the winter monsoon.

In Japan, which was still exercising caution after the cold-weather-related [Tenmei famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenmei_famine "Tenmei famine") of 1782–1788, cold damaged crops, but no crop failures were reported, and there were no adverse effects on population.
