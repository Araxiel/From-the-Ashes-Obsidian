OTL:
New South Wales was the *main one*. Had convicts, ended up having most important people, main driver of confederation.
Western Australia was technically "free settlement", but in 1851 started to ask for convicts because of economic problems.
South Australia was a "free settlement", and very very concerned about staying as such. Also very democratic and progressive (for the time obv.)
Victoria was created in 1851.
