These are a list of countries. I tend to use the name here that makes the most sense, not the game nation-states or states of the time, but the general (modern) OTL understanding of these places. Some of the entries here will also be umbrella groupings (i.e. Balkans)
### Categories
I generally would thematically fit nations into one of these categories:
- [[#Exiles]]
- [[#Displaced]]
- [[#Refugees]]
- [[#Survivors]]
- [[#Unaltered]]

These are extremely loose categories and it's mainly vibes based.
Also, they are not completely exclusives, i.e. Exile nations might have also some Survivors, and what counts as Exile versus Displacement is vague.
Also, the entire world was greatly shook by the event, as such even Survivor nations
#### #Exiles
These are nations who evacuated their people and (more importantly) their government, generally to some form of colonial holding.
##### Major Exiles
[[Britain]]
[[France]]
[[Netherlands]]
##### Minor Exiles
[[Italy]]
#### #Displaced
These are nations which primarily migrated further south but held onto at least some parts of their core territory.
##### Major Displaced
[[Russia]]
[[Spain]]
[[United States]]
[[Ottoman Empire]]
##### Minor Displaced
[[Greece]]
[[Portugal]]
#### #Refugees
Nations or peoples who had no cohesive government response and/or colonial holdings to move to. These people primarily found home in other nations.
##### Major Refugees
[[Germany]]
[[Austria]]
##### Minor Refugees
[[Balkans]]
#### #Survivors
Nations where there was a concentrated (and at least partially successful) government response to stay and weather the storm.
##### Major Survivors
[[Scandinavia]]
##### Minor Survivors
[[Switzerland]]
#### #Unaltered
Nations which general shape or situation largely remained unaltered compared to the others.
##### Major Unaltered
[[Latin America]]
