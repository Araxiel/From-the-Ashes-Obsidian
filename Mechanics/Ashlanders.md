A new type of pop profession called Frostlanders or Ashlanders.
The essentially are like hyper-nerfed peasants, and only exist in decentralized countries.
They work in decentralized subsistence building PMs.

Their point is so decentralised nations can have very low pop numbers while staying stagnant, neither growing, but also not really getting nuked.
